# Computer-Vision-Sprint-15
Age detection model for Supermarket Chain to prevent sell alcohol to underage customers.

Libraries: pandas, numpy, PIL, seaborn, tensorflow, ImageDataGenerator, ResNet50, Sequential, GlobalAveragePooling2D & Adam

# Project description
The supermarket chain would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:

- The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
- Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo = The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age

# Data:
To start working on the task, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.
